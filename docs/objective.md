# CDH1 Mutation Analysis Project

## Project Objective

Study the CDH1 protein (E-cadherin / Cadherin-1) and analyze mutations across different species:
- Human (Homo sapiens)
- Chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes)
- Mouse (Mus musculus)
- Rat (Rattus norvegicus)

## Goals
1. Perform sequence alignment analysis (pairwise and multiple)
2. Construct phylogenetic tree to understand evolutionary relationships
3. Use deep learning (LSTM) to predict mutation impact or sequence classification

## Biological Background
CDH1 gene encodes E-cadherin, a protein crucial for cell-cell adhesion. Mutations in CDH1 are associated with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC).
